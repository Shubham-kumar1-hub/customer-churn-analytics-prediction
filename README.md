# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction

An end-to-end Data Science project that predicts customer churn for a 
telecom company, identifies the key drivers behind churn using SHAP, 
and translates predictions into a quantified business retention strategy.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Customer churn directly impacts recurring revenue. This project answers:
**"Which customers are likely to leave, and what should the business do about it?"**

Using the Telco Customer Churn dataset (7,043 customers, 21 features), 
I built a model that doesn't just predict churn — it segments customers 
by risk and estimates the financial impact of a targeted retention strategy.

| AUC-ROC | 0.833 |
| Recall | 0.789 |
| High-Risk Customers Identified | 372 |
| Estimated Annual Revenue at Risk | $358,667 |
| Estimated Revenue Saved (30% retention) | **$107,600** |

## 🔍 Approach

### 1. Data Pipeline
- Ingested raw CSV into **MySQL**, queried via SQLAlchemy
- Handled missing values (11 rows with blank `TotalCharges`)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Identified key churn drivers: **tenure**, **contract type**, 
  **fiber optic internet**, **payment method**
- Found severe multicollinearity between `tenure` and `TotalCharges` 
  (r=0.83) — dropped `TotalCharges` to stabilize the linear model

### 3. Preprocessing
- Label encoding for binary features
- **Ordinal encoding** for `Contract` (preserving Month-to-month < 
  One year < Two year hierarchy — not naively one-hot encoded)
- One-hot encoding for true nominal features (`InternetService`, `PaymentMethod`)
- Stratified train-test split, scaling fit only on training data (no leakage)

### 4. Modeling — Systematic Comparison
Tested **3 algorithms × 2 imbalance-handling techniques** (5 valid configs):

| Model | Method | Recall | AUC-ROC |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Logistic Regression** | **class_weight** | **0.789** | **0.833** |
| Logistic Regression | SMOTE | 0.727 | 0.827 |
| XGBoost | SMOTE | 0.639 | 0.810 |
| Random Forest | class_weight | 0.489 | 0.814 |
| XGBoost | scale_pos_weight | 0.666 | 0.807 |

**Decision:** Selected Logistic Regression despite Random Forest's higher 
accuracy (0.783 vs 0.729), because Recall and AUC-ROC matter more for 
churn — missing an actual churner costs more than a false alarm.

### 5. Explainability (SHAP)
- Validated EDA hypotheses against model-level feature attributions
- Built local explanations contrasting a retained customer (5.1% churn 
  probability) against a churned customer (94.4% churn probability)

### 6. Business Translation
- Segmented customers into High/Medium/Low risk
- Validated segmentation: High Risk bucket had 61.6% actual churn rate 
  vs 7.8% in Low Risk — confirming the model's probabilities carry real signal
- Quantified retention ROI assuming a conservative 30% intervention success rate

### 7. Deployment
- **FastAPI** backend serving real-time predictions
- **Streamlit** dashboard for single predictions + batch risk insights
- **Dockerized** both services with Docker Compose for local orchestration
- **Deployed live on Render** (two independent web services)

## 📌 Key Learnings

- A simpler, well-tuned model (Logistic Regression) outperformed a more 
  complex one (XGBoost, Random Forest) on the metric that actually mattered 
  for the business — a reminder that model complexity ≠ business value
- Ordinal relationships in categorical data (like contract length) should 
  be explicitly encoded, not flattened into one-hot — preserving this 
  signal improved interpretability without hurting performance
- SHAP-based local explanations make a model's decisions defensible to 
  non-technical stakeholders, not just accurate on paper
